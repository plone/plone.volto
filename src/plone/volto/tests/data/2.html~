<p>Since version 2.0, lxml comes with a dedicated Python package for
dealing with HTML: lxml.html. <br>It is based on lxml's HTML parser, but
provides a special Element API for HTML elements, as well as a number of
utilities for common HTML processing tasks.</p>

<p>The normal HTML parser is capable of handling broken HTML, but for pages that are far
enough from HTML to call them 'tag soup', it may still fail to parse the page in a useful
way. A way to deal with this is ElementSoup, which deploys the well-known BeautifulSoup
parser to build an lxml HTML tree.</p>

<p>However, note that the most common problem with web pages is the lack of (or the
existence of incorrect) encoding declarations. It is therefore often sufficient to only
use the encoding detection of BeautifulSoup, called UnicodeDammit, and to leave the rest
to lxml's own HTML parser, which is several times faster.</p>
