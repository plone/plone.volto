Create a separate `initial` profile which is used to set up the Volto distribution.
The existing `default` profile defines the Volto add-on, and makes minimal changes to existing content types.
The `initial` profile includes the `plone.app.contenttypes:default` profile and fully controls the behaviors for the included content types.
